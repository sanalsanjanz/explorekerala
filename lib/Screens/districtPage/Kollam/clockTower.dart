The tower faces four directions of the city with clocks on all sides, and the fascinating architectural design of the colonial era attracts the tourist to visit here. The clock tower has become a non-official symbol of Kollam and is the busiest part of the city where roads from Thiruvananthapuram, Alappuzha, Downtown, Sengottai, Ashramam, Kollam Beach, and the City bus stand meet.",
