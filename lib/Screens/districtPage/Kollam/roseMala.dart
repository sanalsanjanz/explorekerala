            "Nestled amidst the pretty pristine woods of Shenduruney forests, Rosemala is a well-kept secret of Kerala. Located in the Aryanvaku in the Kollam district, the valley appears the unfurling petals of a rose, hence the name. The highlight of the place is that it can only be reached by a 10 km long trek through the jungle. Boasting of gorgeous surroundings, the major attractions here are a lake and a watchtower. It indeed is one of the most beautiful places to visit in Kollam. The beautiful valley abounds in the bounty of nature and is a mesmerizing place to visit",

            "The beautiful Rosemala is often hailed as the crown of Kollam. Earlier there weren't roads to where the three rivers, which fill the Thenmala dam, originate. With the construction of the concrete road from Aryankavu to the watch tower, travelling to these places became easier. Now, the Rosemala has become a favourite tourist destination of both nature and adventure lovers.");
