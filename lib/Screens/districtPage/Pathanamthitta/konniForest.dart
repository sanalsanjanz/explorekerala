            "Kottayam 60 km. The nearest Airport is Thiruvananthapuram International Airport, about 99 km from Pathanamthitta. Konni has a major elephant training center, located 11 km from Pathanamthitta. The prime attraction here are the huge cages of wood built to house elephants. These cages are locally known as Aanakoodu. The elephants were captured from the dense forests of the western ghats/Sahyadri and brought to the elephant training cage at Konni. There these wild elephants are tamed and trained by mahouts specialized as elephant tainers. These trainers take the help of other tamed elephants.");
